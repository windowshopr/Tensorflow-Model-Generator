# Tensorflow Model Generator
 A proof of concept class object that one could use as part of a Genetic Algorithm to tune entire models (not just their hyperparameters) using TensorFlow. While this simple script CAN tune hyperparameters, it also tests different layer numbers and sizes which is something missing from many autoML packages in this space.
