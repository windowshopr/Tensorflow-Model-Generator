# Tensorflow Model Generator

 A proof of concept class object that one could use as part of a Genetic Algorithm to tune entire models (not just their hyperparameters) using TensorFlow. While this simple script CAN tune hyperparameters, it also tests different layer numbers and sizes which is something missing from many autoML packages in this space.

# Disclaimer

All of my repositories (including this one) are NOT actively maintained. I have disabled issues, so if you decide to download or use any of my projects, you will troubleshoot any issues yourself. You can safely assume that most of my repo's are in a "proof-of-concept" stage; some of them are completed and working, others are just templates that need more work. The repo's I choose to post on GitHub are meant for review, storage and job applications. Thank you.
